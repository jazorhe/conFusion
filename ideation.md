# Assignment: Ideation


**Project Title: Gamer's Blog**

**Student Name: Jiehao Jazor He**

**Course: Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4**

## Introduction

- A brief introduction to your website idea. State the goals of the project.

The goal of the project is to create a blog-like website for my own interest. Display my favourite games and my thoughts about them. Both my emotion playing through the game, and how I think they are technically designed and developed to become what they are.

- The values / benefits (tangible and intangible) this application can bring to a company/organization/end-user.

The value is purely for myself, this will be diary like for me to put my thoughts and notes into a beautiful frame. I can of course still use a blog tool that is available, but I want to have more flexibility than that. So myself is the end-user of this website.


## Expected List of Features

- A brief list of features that you expect your website to support.

1. Gallery with filtering
1. Be able to add article for long thoughts and notes
1. Be able to put short thoughts like twitter

- Brief justifications for including these features.

Visuals are extremely important to games. I want to be able to put media including photos and videos easily onto this website because a lot of the times, the emotion coming from a game can be visually tied to an image. Also for going through technical design details, images will also help in demonstrating my analysis.

## Market Survey

- Do a survey of the Web to find about five web sites that might have similar ideas as yours.

1. IGN
1. Polygon
1. Game Informer
1. VG Time
1. GCores

- Briefly compare the features of these applications with your application idea.

1. IGN is news based, not much of a social element is available on the website. It also has game guides which I am not very interesting in creating it in my website.
1. Polygon is also news based. Plus it focuses a lot on tech in general too. I don't think its too gamer orientated.
1. Game Informer is very gamer orientated, there is again not much of a social element for individuals to express themselves
1. VG Time is gamer orientated, news based, but also have a community for people to post their own thoughts, articles and media. This is very similar to what I would want to have, but it lacks the privacy I wanted and I don't need an audiance, I want to build it for myself. People might be able to find my page on the internet and put comments, but it's not like a big community where your posts will be flooded and flushed out in time.
1. Similar to VG Time.
